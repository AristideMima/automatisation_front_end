## About The Project

This project was carried out as part of an operation to automate bank order checks.

The bankruptcy control operations are very important elements in the bank, allowing it to be able to
control not only system anomalies, but also the situations of its customers.

The main challenge here has been the fact that the data used is a not very
well structured. So it was a question of setting up a system capable of extracting the necessary information.
, automatically perform the necessary calculations and make the results available in the form of Excel files.

So we have set up a Django rest API for the backend and a frontEnd part for the interfaces
with ReactJs.

This is just the frontend repository, the backend can be found here <a href="https://github.com/AristideMima/automatisation_back_end/tree/master"> https://github.com/AristideMima/automatisation_back_end</a>
